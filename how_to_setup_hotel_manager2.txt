I HAVE MADE A DEMO VIDEO OF THE PROJECT WHICH IS UPLOADED TO THE REPOSITORY MAKE SURE YOU WATCH IT FIRST

HOW TO SETUP THE hotel_manager2 :-

IMPORTANT
0. WATCH THE DEMO VIDEO THE MANAGERS PASSWORD IS AS FOLLOWS :- USERNAME = 1, PASSWORD = 1

1. IMPORT THE MYSQL DATABASE NAMED hotel_database

2. there is 1 text file and 15 PNGs that keep the track of the following info:-

2A. BILLS.TXT this file keeps track of the when a user is checking in or out with this it also keeps their booking information if the manager needs

2B. PNGs that are images in the windows

MOST_IMPORTANT
3. now that you have imported the database there is only 1 thing you need to do that is TO CHACNGE THE FILE PATH OF BILLS.TXT AND 51 PNGs in your hotel_manager python file i have mentioned in the comments which which functions will require a file path change and what functions use them.

4. after importing the database and changing the file paths you are all set and done.

5. every function has a docstring which disribes how the function works and what it does. 

6. i tried to keep the program simple so anyone who knows the basics of python can solve it

WHAT IS A HOTEL_DATABASE:-

A hotel database management system is a software application that is used to store, organize, and manage the data related to a hotel's operations. It typically includes information about guests, rooms, reservations, and staff, as well as financial and accounting data.

THE hotel_database HAS 3 TABLES:-

1. customer :- this table has the information of the customer like their id and what room they are staying in

2. room :- this table has the information of the rooms like room_type and who is staying in the room (via customer id)

3. booking_details :- this table has the information of the booking datials of the customer like their pay amount method and no. of people they are staying with

THE SOFTWARE USES 2 THINGS TO OPERATE:-

1. PYTHON:-

The system may also use Python to process the data from the database and present it to the user. Python is a high-level programming language that is known for its readability and simplicity. It can be used to write scripts that can extract data from the database, perform calculations and analysis, and generate reports and other outputs.

2. MYSQL:-

The system may use MySQL as the database to store the data. MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system that is widely used in the hospitality industry. It allows for efficient storage and retrieval of data and offers robust security features to protect sensitive information.
